# Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) - Attack Demonstration

This repository contains configuration files, sample logs, and step-by-step procedures to demonstrate File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using Wazuh. It simulates real-world attacks to showcase how Wazuh detects file modifications, additions, and deletions on endpoints.

## Objective

To provide a clear and repeatable demonstration of Wazuhâ€™s FIM capability by executing various file-based attacks and observing alert generation within the Wazuh dashboard.

---

## Environment Setup

- **Wazuh Manager**: Hosted on a cloud server (e.g., Linode, AWS). I hosted my cloud server in Linode.
  A Documentation for deploying Wazuh Manager can be found here:
  
  ```url
  https://github.com/rohithaider/wazuh-docker-siem-setup
  ```
- **Wazuh Agent**: Installed on Ubuntu VM & Windows 7 (VirtualBox)
- **Version**: Wazuh 4.12+
- **Log Collection**: Direct agent-to-manager communication (no Filebeat)

# Wazuh Configuration for File Integrity Monitoring in Ubuntu.
First edit the ossec.conf file in the Wazuh Agent to monitor the root directory. 

```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```
then add this in the <syscheck> block:

```bash
<directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" realtime="yes">/root</directories>
```

Finally, restart the Wazuh-agent to apply the change:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```
## Testing the configuration in Ubuntu 
I created a text file inside the monitored directory and waited for about 5 seconds to give Wazuh time to detect the creation event. After that, I opened the file, added some content to it, and saved the changes. Again, I waited for another 5 seconds to allow the file modification to be picked up. Finally, I deleted the text file from the monitored directory and waited a few more seconds so the deletion event could be captured by the File Integrity Monitoring system.

1. Creating the file
```bash
sudo touch /root/testfile.txt
sleep 5
```
2. Modify the file
```bash
echo "This is a test modification" | sudo tee -a /root/testfile.txt
sleep 5
```
3. Delete the file
```bash
sudo rm /root/testfile.txt
sleep 5
```

Now let's go the Wazuh dashboard and open the Ubuntu agent. From there go to the File Integrity Monitoring.

Here you can see that the events are showing the in the file integrity monitoring.

# Wazuh Configuration for File Integrity Monitoring in Ubuntu.

First edit the ossec.conf in administrative mode. ```C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf```.

, and add this block 

```bash
<directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" whodata="yes" realtime="yes">C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Desktop</directories>
```

note: I added ```whodata="yes"``` to see who modifies data.

Finally, restart wazuh agent in windows 10. 

```bash
<directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" realtime="yes">C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Desktop</directories>
```

#NOTE: CHANGE YOUR USERNAME ABOVE!

## Testing the configuration in Windows 10.
