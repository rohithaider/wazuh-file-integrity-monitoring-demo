# Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) - Demonstration

This repository contains configuration files, sample logs, and step-by-step procedures to demonstrate File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using Wazuh. It shows how Wazuh detects and logs file modifications, creations, and deletions on monitored endpoints in real time.

## Objective

To provide a clear and repeatable demonstration of Wazuhâ€™s FIM capability by file modification and observing alert generation within the Wazuh dashboard.

---

## Environment Setup
- **Wazuh Manager**: Hosted on a cloud server (e.g., Linode, AWS). I hosted my cloud server in Linode.
  A documentation for deploying Wazuh Manager can be found here: [Wazuh Docker SIEM Setup](https://github.com/rohithaider/wazuh-docker-siem-setup)
- **Wazuh Agent**: Installed on Ubuntu VM & Windows 10 (VirtualBox)
- **Version**: Wazuh 4.12+
- **Log Collection**: Direct agent-to-manager communication ```(no Filebeat)```

# Wazuh Configuration for File Integrity Monitoring in Ubuntu.
First edit the ossec.conf file in the Wazuh Agent to monitor the root directory. 

```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```
then add this in the <syscheck> block:

```bash
<directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" realtime="yes">/root</directories>
```

Finally, restart the Wazuh-agent to apply the change:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```
## Testing the configuration in Ubuntu 
I created a text file inside the monitored directory and waited for about 5 seconds to give Wazuh time to detect the creation event. After that, I opened the file, added some content to it, and saved the changes. Again, I waited for another 5 seconds to allow the file modification to be picked up. Finally, I deleted the text file from the monitored directory and waited a few more seconds so the deletion event could be captured by the File Integrity Monitoring system.

1. Creating the file
```bash
sudo touch /root/testfile.txt
sleep 5
```
2. Modify the file
```bash
echo "This is a test modification" | sudo tee -a /root/testfile.txt
sleep 5
```
3. Delete the file
```bash
sudo rm /root/testfile.txt
sleep 5
```

Now let's go the Wazuh dashboard and open the Ubuntu agent. From there go to the File Integrity Monitoring.

Here you can see that the events are showing the in the file integrity monitoring.

# Wazuh Configuration for File Integrity Monitoring in Windows.

First edit the ossec.conf in administrative mode. ```C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf```.

<img width="997" height="645" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ded998fe-6773-4a3a-b4f7-53f374109e74" />

, and add this block 

```bash
<directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" whodata="yes" realtime="yes">C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\Desktop</directories>
```

#note: I added ```whodata="yes"``` to see who modifies data. 

#WARNING: CHANGE YOUR USERNAME ABOVE!

Finally, change the ossec.conf file and restart Wazuh agent in windows 10. 



## Testing the configuration in Windows 10. 

<img width="1332" height="633" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acabf93f-bca5-4774-9a9e-3ba98c3bb678" />

You can now see that the Wazuh File Integrity monitoring system is actively reporting the alerts about file system changes in Windows 10.
